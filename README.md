# foraminiera_detect
detect foraminiera by vgg16 using python.


you need to create two folders to put the training data and testing data.

then under each folders you need too create classes folders, and put your pictures in to the folders.

before training the model, you need to check the fit setting(main.py line 58-60) is suitable for your hardware otherwise it may lead to crash.

ok that all go training your own model~



(ps the edge_detect_def and webcam_save_pic_button are for getting data)
